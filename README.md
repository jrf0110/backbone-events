#Standalone Backbone Events

This is the events system used inside of backbone. https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone.

##Install

I'm assuming this won't be used with node considering there are better ways to create event emitters. So this is purely intended for client-side usage. Install with jam:

```
jam install backbone-events
```
